# Single Conductor Tests

Today we finished the setup for the single conductor experiments.

We're taking measurements at different distances away.

We'll make a CSV file that records the IDs for the measurements and their corresponding parameters. 

The single conductor was 40' and we took off 33" which makes it 37'3"

The setup is WILMA -> D00 (BNC cable) -> BNC to alligator clips -> Single conductor over ground plane (37'3") at variable distance
