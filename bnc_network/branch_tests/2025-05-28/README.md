# May 28, 2025 Measurements

Today I'm looking at measurements to push the limits of the branching networks. From the analysis of the data on May 22, it seems like the limit would likely be 10 branches deep, but I have only tested 7 thusfar. Today's task will be to go to that limit. See `../README.md`,  `../2025-05-22`, or `../2025-05-21` for more information.
